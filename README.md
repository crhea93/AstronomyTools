A set of tools written for astronomy applications

If you wish to use any of my programs feel free, but please let me first if it is for published material (if you don't mind that is!). I am curious to know how these are being used. This will be updated regularly with new tools :)

I advise cloning the entire repository since several programs require functions in GeneralUse/ToolBox.py


The most used directories are FittingPipeline and TemperatureMapPipeline. Please
see their individual ReadME.md files for more information.
