      <p align="center">The following page describes several tools created for general use in astronomy. Further documentation --such as inputs -- can be found in the beginning of the python files themselves ðŸ˜„</p>
        <h2>Combine Regions </h2>
        <p>This file has the simple task of combining several ds9 regions into a single file. <br>
            It currently supports both the addition and subtraction of regions.</p>
        <h2>Merge </h2>
        <p> The script combines several Chandra OBSIDs after they have been reprocessed</p>
        <h2>MonoEnergy</h2>
        <p>Script with calculates the monochromatic energy for a given energy range and region using weighted arf files</p>
        <h2>Precursor</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, this is one of the more useful tools. It simply creates fits files from regions of interest and subsequently runs specextract on it.</p>
